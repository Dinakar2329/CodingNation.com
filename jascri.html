            <br /><br />
            <h3>What is Programming?</h3>
            <p>
              It is a way to talk to computers. A language like Hindi, English,
              or Bengali can be used to talk to a human but for computers, we
              need straightforward instructions.
              <br />
              Programming is the act of constructing a program, a set of precise
              instructions telling a computer what to do.
              <br />
              Programming is the process of designing, writing, testing,
              debugging, and maintaining the source code of computer programs.
              It involves the use of programming languages and various tools to
              create software programs that can be run on a computer or other
              devices.
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            <h3>What is ECMAScript?</h3>
            <br />
            <p>ECMAScript is a standard on which JavaScript is based!</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              It was created to ensure that different documents on JavaScript
              are talking about the same language.
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            <h3>ECMAScript Versions:</h3>
            <p>Beginning in 1997, JavaScript has evolved into many versions.</p>
            <li>ECMAScript1 or ES1 was first released in 1997.</li>
            <li>
              ECMAScript 2015 also known as ES6 was released in 2015 and a major
              revision to JavaScript was made.
            </li>
            <li>
              The latest version of JavaScript will be ECMaScript2022 (ES13) in
              2022.
            </li>

            <br />
            <li>JavaScript is a lightweight, OOP language.</li>
            <li>It is a scripting language for web pages.</li>

            <h2>JS Execution</h2>
            <br /><br />
            <h3>Do we need to install Javascript?</h3>
            <br />
            <p>The answer is NO.</p>
            <p>
              JavaScript is present everywhere in browsers, on your phone, etc.
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            <h3>How to execute JavaScript?</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              JavaScript can be executed right inside one’s browser. You can
              open the JS console and start writing JS there.
              <br />
              Another way to execute JS is a runtime like Node.js which can be
              installed and used to run JavaScript code.
              <br />
              Yet another way to execute JavaScript is by inserting it inside
              the &lt;script&gt; tag of an HTML document.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              JavaScript is a programming language that is commonly used in web
              development. It is a client-side language, which means that it is
              executed by the user's web browser rather than the web server.
              This allows JavaScript to interact with the user and create
              dynamic, interactive web pages.
            </p>
            <p>
              JavaScript is often used in combination with HTML and CSS to
              create web pages that are more interactive and engaging. It can be
              used to create all sorts of effects, such as drop-down menus,
              image sliders, and pop-up windows.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Getting Started with JavaScript</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              To start using JavaScript, you'll need a text editor and a web
              browser. There are many text editors available, such as Sublime
              Text, Atom, and Visual Studio Code, which are all popular choices
              among developers.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Once you have a text editor set up, you can start writing
              JavaScript code. To do this, you'll need to create a new file with
              a .js extension and then type your code into the file. You can
              then save the file and open it in your web browser to see the
              results.

            <h2>Node.js Installation</h2>
            <br />
            <h3>Node.js Installation</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime
              environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web
              browser. It is commonly used for building server-side
              applications, command-line tools, and other types of scalable
              network programs.
              <br />
              To install Node.js, you can follow these steps:
            </p>
            <br />
            <li>
              Download the installer: Go to the official Node.js websitea
              <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank"
                >(https://nodejs.org/)</a
              >
              and click the "Download" button to download the latest version of
              the Node.js installer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Run the installer: Double-click the downloaded installer file to
              start the installation process. Follow the prompts to complete the
              installation.
            </li>
            <li>
              Verify the installation: To verify that Node.js has been installed
              successfully, open a terminal or command prompt and type the
              following command:
            </li>
            <br />
            <p>Run the following command:</p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    node -v
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              This should output the version number of Node.js that you have
              installed.
            </p>
            <p>
              That's it! You should now have Node.js installed on your system
              and be able to run JavaScript code using the "node" command.
            </p>
            <p>I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any questions.</p>
            <br />
            <h3>Script using Node.js</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              To run JavaScript with Visual Studio Code (VS Code), you will need
              to follow these steps:
            </p>
            <br />
            <li>
              Install VS Code: If you don't already have it, you can download
              and install VS Code from the official website
              <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank"
                >(https://code.visualstudio.com/)</a
              >.
            </li>
            <li>
              Create a new JavaScript file: Open VS Code and create a new file
              with a .js extension. You can do this by going to File > New File
              or by using the shortcut Ctrl + N.
            </li>
            <li>
              Write your JavaScript code: Type your JavaScript code into the
              file and save it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Open the Command Palette: You can open the Command Palette by
              pressing Ctrl + Shift + P or by going to View > Command Palette.
            </li>
            <li>
              Run the JavaScript file: In the Command Palette, type "Run
              JavaScript" and select "Run JavaScript file in the terminal" from
              the list of options. This will open a terminal window and run your
              JavaScript file.
            </li>
            <li>
              View the output: The output of your JavaScript code will be
              displayed in the terminal window.
            </li>
            <br />
            <p>
              Alternatively, you can also run JavaScript code directly in the
              terminal by using a command-line interpreter such as Node.js. To
              do this, you will need to install Node.js and then run your
              JavaScript file using the "node" command, followed by the name of
              the file. For example:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    node myfile.js
</Code>
</Pre>

          <div class="notes" id="div4" style="display: none">
            <h2>What are Variables?</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              In JavaScript, variables are used to store data. They are an
              essential part of any programming language, as they allow you to
              store, retrieve, and manipulate data in your programs.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              There are a few different ways to declare variables in JavaScript,
              each with its own syntax and rules. In this blog post, we'll take
              a look at the different types of variables available in JavaScript
              and how to use them.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Declaring Variables</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              To declare a variable in JavaScript, you use the "var" keyword
              followed by the name of the variable. For example:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    var x;
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              This declares a variable called "x" but does not assign any value
              to it. You can also assign a value to a variable when you declare
              it, like this:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    var x = 10;
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              In JavaScript, you can also use the "let" and "const" keywords to
              declare variables. The "let" keyword is used to declare a variable
              that can be reassigned later, while the "const" keyword is used to
              declare a variable that cannot be reassigned. For example:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    let y = 20;
const z = 30;
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              In this example, "y" is a variable that can be reassigned, while
              "z" is a constant that cannot be reassigned.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Data Types</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              In JavaScript, there are several data types that you can use to
              store different types of data. Some common data types include:
            </p>
            <br />
            <li>Numbers (e.g. 10, 3.14)</li>
            <li>Strings (e.g. "hello", 'world')</li>
            <li>Booleans (e.g. true, false)</li>
            <li>Arrays (e.g. [1, 2, 3])</li>
            <li>Objects (e.g. { name: "John", age: 30 })</li>
            <br />
          </div>
          <div class="notes" id="div5" style="display: none">
            <h3>Variable Naming Rules</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, which means that you
              don't have to specify the data type of a variable when you declare
              it. The data type of a variable is determined by the value that is
              assigned to it. For example:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    var x = 10; // x is a number
var y = "hello"; // y is a string
var z = [1, 2, 3]; // z is an array
</Code> 
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h3>Variable Naming Rules</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              There are a few rules that you need to follow when naming
              variables in JavaScript:
            </p>
            <br />
            <li>
              Variable names can only contain letters, digits, underscores, and
              dollar signs.
            </li>
            <li>Variable names cannot start with a digit.</li>
            <li>Variable names are case-sensitive.</li>
            <br />
            <p>
              It is also a good practice to use descriptive and meaningful names
              for your variables, as this makes your code easier to read and
              understand.
            </p>

            <h3>Using Variables</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              Once you have declared a variable, you can use it to store and
              retrieve data in your program. For example:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    var x = 10;
console.log(x); // prints 10

x = "hello";
console.log(x); // prints "hello"
</Code> 
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              You can also perform various operations on variables, such as
              mathematical calculations, string concatenation, and more. For
              example:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    var x = 10;
var y = 20;
var z = x + y; // z is 30

var str1 = "hello";
var str2 = "world";
var str3 = str1 + " " + str2; // str3 is "hello world"
</Code> 
</Pre>
            <br />

            <h2>var vs let vs const</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              In JavaScript, there are three ways to declare variables: var,
              let, and const. Each of these keywords has its own rules and uses,
              and it is important to understand the differences between them in
              order to write effective and maintainable code.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>var</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              The "var" keyword is used to declare variables in JavaScript. It
              was introduced in the early days of the language and was the only
              way to declare variables for a long time. However, the "var"
              keyword has some limitations and has been largely replaced by the
              "let" and "const" keywords in modern JavaScript.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              One of the main issues with "var" is that it is function-scoped,
              rather than block-scoped. This means that variables declared with
              "var" are accessible within the entire function in which they are
              declared, rather than just within the block of code in which they
              appear. This can lead to unexpected behavior and can make it
              difficult to reason about the scope of variables in your code.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>let</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              The "let" keyword was introduced in ECMAScript 6 (also known as
              ES6) and is used to declare variables that can be reassigned
              later. "let" variables are block-scoped, which means that they are
              only accessible within the block of code in which they are
              declared. This makes them more predictable and easier to reason
              about than "var" variables.
              <br />
              For example:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    if (x > 10) {
  let y = 20;
  console.log(y); // 20
}
console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              In this example, the "y" variable is declared with the "let"
              keyword and is only accessible within the block of the if
              statement. If you try to access it outside of the block, you will
              get a "ReferenceError" because "y" is not defined in that scope.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>const</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              The "const" keyword was also introduced in ES6 and is used to
              declare variables that cannot be reassigned later. "const"
              variables are also block-scoped and behave similarly to "let"
              variables in that respect. However, the main difference is that
              "const" variables must be initialized with a value when they are
              declared and cannot be reassigned later.
              <br />
              For example:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    const PI = 3.14;
PI = 3.14159; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              In this example, the "PI" variable is declared with the "const"
              keyword and is assigned the value of 3.14. If you try to reassign
              a new value to "PI," you will get a "TypeError" because "PI" is a
              constant variable and cannot be changed.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              In summary, "var" is an old way of declaring variables that is
              function-scoped and can be reassigned. "let" is a newer way of
              declaring variables that is block-scoped and can be reassigned.
              "const" is a newer way of declaring variables that is block-scoped
              and cannot be reassigned. In modern JavaScript, it is generally
              recommended to use "let" and "const" instead of "var," as they
              provide better scoping and make it easier to write maintainable
              code.

            <h2>Primitives and Objects</h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              In JavaScript, there are two main types of data: primitives and
              objects.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Primitives</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              Primitives are the simplest and most basic data types in
              JavaScript. They include:
            </p>
            <br />
            <li>Numbers (e.g. 10, 3.14)</li>
            <li>Strings (e.g. "hello", 'world')</li>
            <li>Booleans (e.g. true, false)</li>
            <li>Null (a special value that represents an absence of value)</li>
            <li>
              Undefined (a special value that represents an uninitialized
              variable)
            </li>
            <br />
            <p>
              Primitives are immutable, which means that once they are created,
              they cannot be changed. For example:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    let x = 10;
x = 20; // x is now 20 
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              In this example, the value of "x" is changed from 10 to 20.
              However, this does not change the value of the primitive itself,
              but rather creates a new primitive with the value of 20.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Objects</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              Objects are more complex data types in JavaScript and are used to
              represent real-world objects or abstract concepts. They are
              composed of key-value pairs, where the keys are strings and the
              values can be any data type (including primitives and other
              objects).
              <br />
              Objects are mutable, which means that they can be changed after
              they are created. For example:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    let obj = { name: "John", age: 30 };
obj.age = 31; // the age property of obj is now 31
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              In this example, the "age" property of the "obj" object is changed
              from 30 to 31. This changes the value of the object itself, rather
              than creating a new object.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              There are several other data types in JavaScript that are
              classified as objects, including arrays, functions, and dates.
              These data types behave similarly to objects in that they are
              mutable and can be modified after they are created.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              In summary, primitives are the simplest data types in JavaScript
              and are immutable. Objects are more complex data types that are
              used to represent real-world objects or abstract concepts and are
              mutable. It is important to understand the differences between
              these two types of data in order to write effective and
              maintainable code in JavaScript.

            <h3>Operators and Expressions</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              Operators in JavaScript are symbols that perform specific
              operations on one or more operands (values or variables). For
              example, the addition operator (+) adds two operands together and
              the assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.
              <br />
              There are several types of operators in JavaScript, including:
            </p>
            <br />
            <li>Arithmetic operators (e.g. +, -, *, /, %)</li>
            <li>Comparison operators (e.g. >, <,>=, <=,==, !=)</li>
            <li>Logical operators (e.g. &&, ||, !)</li>
            <li>Assignment operators (e.g. =, +=, -=, *=, /=)</li>
            <li>Conditional (ternary) operator (e.g. ?:)</li>
            <br />
            <p>
              Expressions are combinations of values, variables, and operators
              that produce a result. For example:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    let x = 10;
let y = 20;
let z = x + y; // z is 30
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              In this example, the expression "x + y" is evaluated to 30 and
              assigned to the "z" variable.
              <br />
              Operator precedence determines the order in which operators are
              applied when an expression has multiple operators. For example:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    let x = 10 + 5 * 3; // x is 25
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              In this example, the multiplication operator (*) has a higher
              precedence than the addition operator (+), so the multiplication
              is performed before the addition. As a result, the expression is
              evaluated as 10 + (5 * 3) = 25.
              <br />
              You can use parentheses to specify the order of operations in an
              expression. For example:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    let x = (10 + 5) * 3; // x is 45
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              In this example, the parentheses indicate that the addition should
              be performed before the multiplication. As a result, the
              expression is evaluated as (10 + 5) * 3 = 45.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              In summary, operators are symbols that perform specific operations
              on one or more operands, and expressions are combinations of

              precedence determines the order in which operators are applied in
              an expression, and parentheses can be used to specify the order of
              operations. Understanding how to use operators and expressions is
              an important part of programming in JavaScript.

            <h3>If else conditionals</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              The "if" statement in JavaScript is used to execute a block of
              code if a certain condition is met. The "else" clause is used to
              execute a block of code if the condition is not met.
              <br />
              Here is the basic syntax for an "if" statement:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    if (condition) {
  // code to be executed if condition is true
}
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              Here is the syntax for an "if" statement with an "else" clause:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    if (condition) {
  // code to be executed if condition is true
} else {
  // code to be executed if condition is false
}
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              The condition is a boolean expression that evaluates to either
              true or false. If the condition is true, the code in the "if"
              block is executed. If the condition is false, the code in the
              "else" block is executed (if present).
              <br />
              For example:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    let x = 10;
if (x > 5) {
  console.log("x is greater than 5");
} else {
  console.log("x is not greater than 5");
}
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              In this example, the condition "x > 5" is true, so the code in the
              "if" block is executed and the message "x is greater than 5" is
              printed to the console
            </p>

            <h3>If else ladder</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              The "if-else ladder" is a control structure in JavaScript that
              allows you to execute a different block of code depending on
              multiple conditions. It is called a ladder because it consists of
              multiple "if" and "else" statements arranged in a ladder-like
              fashion.
              <br />
              Here is the syntax for an "if-else ladder":
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    if (condition1) {
  // code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // code to be executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else if (condition3) {
  // code to be executed if condition1 and condition2 are false and condition3 is true
} ...
else {
  // code to be executed if all conditions are false
}
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              In this structure, each "if" statement is followed by an optional
              "else" statement. If the first "if" condition is true, the code in
              the corresponding block is executed and the rest of the ladder is
              skipped. If the first "if" condition is false, the second "if"
              condition is evaluated, and so on. If none of the conditions are
              true, the code in the "else" block is executed.
              <br />
              For example:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    let x = 10;
if (x > 15) {
  console.log("x is greater than 15");
} else if (x > 10) {
  console.log("x is greater than 10 but less than or equal to 15");
} else if (x > 5) {
  console.log("x is greater than 5 but less than or equal to 10");
} else {
  console.log("x is less than or equal to 5");
}
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              In this example, the first "if" condition "x > 15" is false, so
              the second "if" condition "x > 10" is evaluated. This condition is
              also false, so the third "if" condition "x > 5" is evaluated. This
              condition is true, so the code in the corresponding block is
              executed and the message "x is greater than 5 but less than or
              equal to 10" is printed to the console.
              <br />
              The "if-else ladder" is a useful control structure for executing
              different blocks of code based on multiple conditions. It can help
              you write more concise and maintainable code in JavaScript.

            <h3>Switch case</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              The "switch" statement in JavaScript is another control structure
              that allows you to execute a different block of code depending on
              a specific value. It is often used as an alternative to the
              "if-else ladder" when you have multiple conditions to check
              against a single value.
              <br />
              Here is the syntax for a "switch" statement:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // code to be executed if expression == value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // code to be executed if expression == value2
    break;
  ...
  default:
    // code to be executed if expression does not match any of the values
}
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              In this structure, the "expression" is evaluated and compared to
              each of the "case" values. If the "expression" matches a "case"
              value, the corresponding block of code is executed. The "break"
              statement is used to exit the "switch" statement and prevent the
              code in the following cases from being executed. The "default"
              case is optional and is executed if the "expression" does not
              match any of the "case" values.
              <br />
              For example:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    let x = "apple";
switch (x) {
  case "apple":
    console.log("x is an apple");
    break;
  case "banana":
    console.log("x is a banana");
    break;
  case "orange":
    console.log("x is an orange");
    break;
  default:
    console.log("x is something else");
}
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              In this example, the "expression" is the variable "x," which has
              the value "apple." The "expression" is compared to each of the
              "case" values, and when it matches the value "apple," the
              corresponding block of code is executed and the message "x is an
              apple" is printed to the console.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The "switch" statement is a useful control structure for executing
              different blocks of code based on a specific value. It can help
              you write more concise and maintainable code in JavaScript.

            <h3>Ternary Operator</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              The ternary operator is a shorthand way to write an if-else
              statement in JavaScript. It takes the form of condition ? value1 :
              value2, where condition is a boolean expression, and value1 and
              value2 are expressions of any type. If condition is true, the
              ternary operator returns value1; if condition is false, it returns
              value2.
              <br />
              Here's an example of how you can use the ternary operator to
              assign a value to a variable based on a condition:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    let x = 10;
let y = 20;
let max;

max = (x > y) ? x : y;

console.log(max); // Outputs: 20
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              In this example, the ternary operator checks whether x is greater
              than y. If it is, max is assigned the value of x; otherwise, it is
              assigned the value of y.
              <br />
              The ternary operator can be a useful and concise way to write
              simple if-else statements, but it can become difficult to read and
              understand when used for more complex statements or nested inside
              other expressions. In these cases, it may be better to use a
              regular if-else statement instead.
            </p>

            <h3>For Loops</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              For loops are a common control flow structure in programming that
              allows you to repeat a block of code a specific number of times.
              In JavaScript, there are three types of for loops: the standard
              for loop, the for-in loop, and the for-of loop.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h3>Standard for loop</h3>
            <br />
            <p>The standard for loop has the following syntax:</p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
  // code to be executed
}
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              The initialization the statement is executed before the loop
              starts and is typically used to initialize a counter variable. The
              condition is checked at the beginning of each iteration and if it
              is true, the loop continues. If it is false, the loop exits. The
              increment/decrement statement is executed at the end of each
              iteration and is used to update the counter variable.
              <br />
              Here's an example of a standard for loop that counts from 1 to 10:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>This loop will print the numbers 1 through 10 to the console.</p>
            <br />
            <h3>For-in loop</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              The for-in loop is used to iterate over the properties of an
              object. It has the following syntax:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    for (variable in object) {
  // code to be executed
}
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              The variable is assigned the name of each property in the object
              as the loop iterates over them.
              <br />
              Here's an example of a for-in loop that iterates over the
              properties of an object:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    let person = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  job: "developer"
};

for (let key in person) {
  console.log(key + ": " + person[key]);
}  
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>This loop will print the following to the console</p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
name: John
age: 30
job: developer  
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <h3>For-of loop</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              The for-of loop is used to iterate over the values of an iterable
              object, such as an array or a string. It has the following syntax:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    for (variable of object) {
  // code to be executed
}
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              The variable is assigned the value of each element in the object
              as the loop iterates over them.
              <br />
              Here's an example of a for-of loop that iterates over the elements
              of an array:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for (let number of numbers) {
  console.log(number);
}
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              This loop will print the numbers 1 through 5 to the console.
              <br />
              For loops are a powerful tool in JavaScript and can be used to
              perform a variety of tasks, such as iterating over arrays and
              objects, repeating a block of code a specific number of times, and
              more. With the three types of for loops available in JavaScript,
              you can choose the one that best fits your needs and use it to
              write more efficient and effective code.

            <h3>While Loop</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              While loops are a control flow structure in programming that allow
              you to repeat a block of code while a certain condition is true.
              In JavaScript, the syntax for a while loop is:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    while (condition) {
  // code to be executed
}
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              The condition is checked at the beginning of each iteration and if
              it is true, the code block is executed. If it is false, the loop
              exits.
              <br />
              Here's an example of a while loop that counts from 1 to 10:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    let i = 1;

while (i <= 10) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              This loop will print the numbers 1 through 10 to the console.
              <br />
              It's important to include a way to update the condition within the
              loop, otherwise it will become an infinite loop and will run
              forever. In the example above, the i++ statement increments the
              value of i by 1 at the end of each iteration, which eventually
              causes the condition to be false and the loop to exit.
              <br />
              While loops can be useful when you don't know exactly how many
              times you need to execute a block of code. For example, you might
              use a while loop to keep prompting a user for input until they
              provide a valid response.
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    let input = "";

while (input !== "yes" && input !== "no") {
  input = prompt("Please enter 'yes' or 'no':");
}
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              This loop will keep prompting the user for input until they enter
              either "yes" or "no".
              <br />
              While loops can be a useful tool in JavaScript, but it's important
              to use them with caution. If the condition is never met, the loop
              will become an infinite loop and will run forever. Make sure to
              include a way to update the condition and eventually exit the loop
              to avoid this issue.

            <h3>Functions</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              JavaScript functions are blocks of code that can be defined and
              executed whenever needed. They are a crucial part of JavaScript
              programming and are used to perform specific tasks or actions.
              <br />
              Functions are often referred to as "first-class citizens" in
              JavaScript because they can be treated like any other value, such
              as a number or a string. This means that they can be assigned to
              variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as
              values from functions.
              <br />
              Here's the basic syntax for defining a function in JavaScript:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    function functionName(parameters) {
  // code to be executed
}
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              The functionName is a unique identifier for the function, and the
              parameters are the variables that are passed to the function when
              it is called. These parameters act as placeholders for the actual
              values that are passed to the function when it is executed.
              <br />
              Here's an example of a simple function that takes a single
              parameter and returns the square of that number:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    function square(x) {
  return x * x;
}
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              To call this function, you would simply use the function name
              followed by the arguments in parentheses:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    let result = square(5);  // returns 25
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>Functions can also have multiple parameters, like this:</p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    function add(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              In this case, the add function takes two parameters, x and y, and
              returns their sum.
              <br />
              JavaScript also has a special type of function called an "arrow
              function," which uses a shorter syntax. Here's the same square a
              function defined using an arrow function:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    const square = (x) => {
  return x * x;
};
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              Arrow functions are often used when you want to create a small,
              one-line function that doesn't require a separate function
              keyword.
              <br />
              Functions can be defined inside other functions, which is known as
              "nesting." This is useful for creating smaller, reusable blocks of
              code that can be called from within the larger function.
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    function outerFunction(x) {
  function innerFunction() {
    // code to be executed
  }
  // more code
} 
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              In this example, the innerFunction is defined inside the
              outerFunction and can only be called from within that function.
              <br />
              In addition to these basic concepts, there are many other things
              you can do with functions in JavaScript, such as passing functions
              as arguments, creating anonymous functions, and using higher-order
              functions. These advanced techniques can make your code more
              efficient and flexible, and are essential tools for any JavaScript
              developer.

            <p>
              One of the most important aspects of JavaScript is its ability to
              manipulate strings, which are sequences of characters. In this
              blog post, we will explore the basics of JavaScript strings and
              the various string methods that can be used to manipulate them.
              <br />
              A string in JavaScript is a sequence of characters enclosed in
              either single or double quotes. For example, the following are
              valid strings in JavaScript:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    "Hello World"
'Hello World'
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              JavaScript provides a number of built-in methods for manipulating
              strings. Some of the most commonly used string methods are:
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              length - This method returns the number of characters in a string.
              For example, the following code will return 11:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    var str = "Hello World";
console.log(str.length);
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              concat - This method is used to concatenate (combine) two or more
              strings. For example, the following code will return "Hello
              World":
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    var str1 = "Hello";
var str2 = " World";
console.log(str1.concat(str2));
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              indexOf - This method is used to find the index of a specific
              character or substring in a string. For example, the following
              code will return 6:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    var str = "Hello World";
console.log(str.indexOf("W"));
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              slice - This method is used to extract a portion of a string. For
              example, the following code will return "World":
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    var str = "Hello World";
console.log(str.slice(6));
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              replace - This method is used to replace a specific character or
              substring in a string. For example, the following code will return
              "Hello Universe":
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    var str = "Hello World";
console.log(str.replace("World", "Universe"));
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              toUpperCase and toLowerCase - These methods are used to convert a
              string to uppercase or lowercase letters. For example, the
              following code will return "HELLO WORLD" and "hello world"
              respectively:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    var str = "Hello World";
console.log(str.toUpperCase());
console.log(str.toLowerCase());
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              These are just a few of the many string methods available in
              JavaScript. By understanding the basics of strings and the various
              methods that can be used to manipulate them, you can create more
              dynamic and interactive web pages. So, start experimenting with
              different string methods and see what you can create!

            <h3>Arrays and Array Methods</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              One of the most important data structures in JavaScript is the
              array, which is a collection of elements. In this blog post, we
              will explore the basics of JavaScript arrays and the various array
              methods that can be used to manipulate them.
              <br />
              An array in JavaScript is a collection of elements enclosed in
              square brackets. Elements can be of any data type, including
              numbers, strings, and other arrays. For example, the following is
              a valid array in JavaScript:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    var myArray = [1, "Hello", [2, 3]];
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              JavaScript provides a number of built-in methods for manipulating
              arrays. Some of the most commonly used array methods are:
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              length - This method returns the number of elements in an array.
              For example, the following code will return 3:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    var myArray = [1, "Hello", [2, 3]];
console.log(myArray.length);
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              push - This method is used to add an element to the end of an
              array. For example, the following code will add the element
              "World" to the end of the array:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    var myArray = [1, "Hello", [2, 3]];
myArray.push("World");
console.log(myArray); // [1, "Hello", [2, 3], "World"]
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              pop - This method is used to remove the last element of an array.
              For example, the following code will remove the last element
              ("World") from the array:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    var myArray = [1, "Hello", [2, 3], "World"];
myArray.pop();
console.log(myArray); // [1, "Hello", [2, 3]]
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              shift - This method is used to remove the first element of an
              array. For example, the following code will remove the first
              element (1) from the array:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    var myArray = [1, "Hello", [2, 3]];
myArray.shift();
console.log(myArray); // [ "Hello", [2, 3]]
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              unshift - This method is used to add an element to the beginning
              of an array. For example, the following code will add the element
              0 to the beginning of the array:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    var myArray = [1, "Hello", [2, 3]];
myArray.unshift(0);
console.log(myArray); // [0, 1, "Hello", [2, 3]]
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              slice - This method is used to extract a portion of an array. For
              example, the following code will extract the elements from index 1
              to 2 (exclusive):
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    var myArray = [1, "Hello", [2, 3]];
console.log(myArray.slice(1, 2)); // ["Hello"]
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              splice - This method is used to add or remove elements from an
              array. For example, the following code will remove the element at
              index 1 and add the elements "Hello World" and [4, 5] at index 1:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    var myArray = [1, "Hello", [2, 3]];
myArray.splice(1, 1, "Hello World", [4, 5]);
console.
</Code>

            <h3>Loops with Arrays</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              One of the most important data structures in JavaScript is the
              array, which is a collection of elements. When working with
              arrays, it is often necessary to iterate through each element in
              the array, which is where loops come in. In this blog post, we
              will explore how to use loops with arrays in JavaScript.
              <br />
              JavaScript provides several ways to iterate through an array,
              including the for loop, forEach method, and for...of loop.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              for loop - This is the most basic way to iterate through an array.
              The for loop uses a counter variable that is incremented on each
              iteration. For example, the following code will print out each
              element in the array:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    var myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for (var i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {
    console.log(myArray[i]);
}
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              forEach method - This method is a more concise way to iterate
              through an array. The forEach method takes a callback function as
              its argument, which is called on each element in the array. For
              example, the following code will print out each element in the
              array:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    var myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
myArray.forEach(function(element) {
    console.log(element);
});
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              for...of loop - This is a more recent addition to JavaScript, and
              it is the most concise way to iterate through an array. It allows
              you to iterate through the elements of an array without having to
              access the index, and it works with any iterable object, not just
              arrays. For example, the following code will print out each
              element in the array:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    var myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for (var element of myArray) {
    console.log(element);
}
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              It is important to note that when you are iterating through an
              array using a for loop and you plan to change the array during
              iteration you should use a for loop with a separate counter
              variable.

            <h3>Map, Filter and Reduce</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              One of the most important data structures in JavaScript is the
              array, which is a collection of elements. When working with
              arrays, it is often necessary to manipulate the elements in
              various ways, which is where the built-in methods map, filter, and
              reduce come in. In this blog post, we will explore how to use
              these methods to manipulate arrays in JavaScript.
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            <p>
              Map - The map method is used to create a new array with the result
              of a callback function called on each element in the original
              array. The callback function takes one argument, the current
              element, and returns the new value for that element. For example,
              the following code will return an array of each element multiplied
              by 2:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    var myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
var multipliedArray = myArray.map(function(element) {
    return element * 2;
});
console.log(multipliedArray); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              Filter - The filter method is used to filter an array based on a
              certain condition. The filter method takes a callback function as
              its argument, which is called on each element in the array. If the
              function returns true, the element is included in the new filtered
              array. For example, the following code will return an array of all
              even numbers in the original array:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    var myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
var evenNumbers = myArray.filter(function(element) {
    return element % 2 === 0;
});
console.log(evenNumbers); // [2, 4]
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              Reduce - The reduce method is used to reduce an array to a single
              value. The reduce method takes a callback function as its
              argument, which is called on each element in the array. The
              callback function takes two arguments, the accumulator and the
              current element, and returns the new value for the accumulator.
              For example, the following code will return the sum of all
              elements in the array:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    var myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
var sum = myArray.reduce(function(acc, cur) {
    return acc + cur;
}, 0);
console.log(sum); // 15
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              It's important to note that these methods work on the original
              array and doesn't change it, it returns a new array.
              <br />
              Combining these three methods can be powerful, for example, you
              can filter an array, then map the filtered array, and finally
              reduce the mapped array.
              <br />
              In conclusion, understanding and utilizing the map, filter, and
              reduce methods in JavaScript can greatly improve your ability to
              manipulate arrays and perform complex operations on them. These
              methods are not only more concise but also more efficient than
              traditional loops and make your code more readable.

            <h3>Date</h3>
            <p>
              JavaScript's Date object allows you to work with dates and times
              in your scripts. It can be used to get the current date and time,
              or to manipulate and format dates and times in various ways.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Creating a new Date object is simple. You can either create a new
              date object with the current date and time by calling new Date()
              with no arguments, or you can create a date object with a specific
              date and time by passing in a string or numerical values.
              <br />
              Here's an example of how you can use the Date object to get the
              current date and time:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    var currentDate = new Date();
console.log(currentDate);
</Code>
</Pre>

            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              You can also manipulate the date and time using the various
              methods available on the Date object. For example, you can use the
              setDate() method to set the day of the month, and the
              setFullYear() method to set the year.

              One of the most commonly used properties of the window object is
              the document property, which represents the current web page. This
              property can be used to access the HTML elements on a page, as
              well as manipulate them. For example, the following code can be
              used to change the text of a specific element on a page:

              The JavaScript history object is a part of the window object and
              provides access to the browser's history. It allows developers to
              manipulate the browser's history and change the current URL
              without reloading the page.
              <br />
              One of the most commonly used methods of the history object is the
              pushState() method. This method allows developers to add a new
              entry to the browser's history and change the current URL without
              reloading the page. For example, the following code can be used to
              change the current URL to "https://www.example.com" and add an
              entry to the browser's history:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    history.pushState(null, null, "https://www.example.com");
</Code>

            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              Another important method is the replaceState() method which is
              similar to pushState() but it replaces the current entry in the
              history instead of creating a new one.
              <br />
              It is also possible to navigate through the browser's history
              using the back() and forward() methods. These methods allow
              developers to navigate to the previous or next page in the
              history, respectively. For example, the following code can be used
              to navigate to the previous page in the history:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    history.back();
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              The length property of the history object returns the number of
              entries in the browser's history. Developers can use this property
              to check how many pages the user has visited and provide
              appropriate navigation options.
              <br />
              It's important to note that the history object is not a perfect
              solution for all navigation needs and it can only be used to
              navigate within the same origin. Also, the history object is part
              of the HTML5 specification and it is not supported in all
              browsers, so it's important to check the browser compatibility
              before using it.
              <br />
              In conclusion, the JavaScript history object provides a powerful
              set of tools for manipulating the browser's history and changing
              the current URL without reloading the page. Understanding how to
              use the history object is essential for creating single-page
              applications (SPA) and improving the user experience. However,
              it's important to keep in mind its limitations and check the
              browser compatibility before using it.

              <br />
              One of the most commonly used properties of the navigator object
              is the userAgent property. This property returns a string that
              represents the browser's user agent. Developers can use this
              property to detect the browser type and version. For example, the
              following code can be used to check if the user is using Google
              Chrome:
            </p>

              In conclusion, the <color>getElementsByName()</color> method is a
              powerful tool for accessing multiple elements on a web page by
              their name attribute. Understanding how to use this method is
              essential for creating dynamic and interactive web pages, as it
              allows developers to quickly and easily access multiple elements
              that share the same name attribute. However, it's important to
              keep in mind that the method returns a live HTMLCollection and is
              case-sensitive. Additionally, this method is mostly used for form
              elements like radio buttons, checkboxes and input fields.

              The <color>getElementsByTagName()</color> method is a convenient
              way to access multiple elements on a web page, as it allows
              developers to select elements based on their HTML tag name. This
              method is especially useful when working with large and complex
              web pages, as it allows developers to quickly and easily access
              multiple elements of the same type.
              <br />
              It's important to note that the
              <color>getElementsByTagName()</color> method returns a live
              HTMLCollection, which means that the collection is updated
              automatically as elements are added or removed from the web page.
              Also, this method is case-sensitive, meaning that "p" and "P" are
              considered to be different tag names.
              <br />
              In conclusion, the <color>getElementsByTagName()</color> method is
              a powerful tool for accessing multiple elements on a web page by

              Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that
              uses objects and their interactions to design applications and
              computer programs. One of the fundamental concepts of OOP is the
              class. In JavaScript, classes are used to define the blueprint for
              objects, allowing developers to create objects that share the same
              properties and methods.
              <br />
              A class in JavaScript is defined using the
              <color>class</color> keyword, followed by the class name. The
              class body is defined within curly braces {} and contains the
              properties and methods of the class.
              <br />
              For example, consider the following class
              <color>Person</color> that defines a person's name and age:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    class Person {
    constructor(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
}
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              The <color>constructor</color> method is a special method that is
              called when a new object is created from the class. It is used to
              initialize the properties of the object. In this example, the
              constructor takes in two parameters <color>name</color> and
              <color>age</color> and assigns them to the object's properties.
              <br />
              You can create a new object using the <color>new</color> keyword
              and passing in any required arguments to the constructor. For
              example:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    let person1 = new Person("John", 30);
let person2 = new Person("Jane", 25);
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              You can also add methods to a class by defining them within the
              class body. For example, you could add a method called
              <color>greet()</color> that returns a greeting message:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    class Person {
    constructor(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    greet() {
        return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`;
    }
}
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              JavaScript classes also support inheritance and polymorphism which
              are fundamental concepts of OOP, but beyond the scope of this
              blog.
              <br />
              In conclusion, classes in JavaScript are used to define the
              blueprint for objects and provide a way to create objects that
              share the same properties and methods. The
              <color>class</color> keyword is used to define a class, and the
              <color>constructor</color> method is used to initialize the
              properties of the object. Classes also provide a way to add
              methods to the object, making it easy to create reusable code.
              Understanding how to use classes in JavaScript is essential for
              creating robust and maintainable code.

            <p>
              Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that
              uses objects and their interactions to design applications and
              computer programs. In JavaScript, objects are a fundamental
              concept, and they are used to represent real-world entities, such
              as a person, a car, or a bank account.
              <br />
              JavaScript objects are created using the {} notation, also known
              as object literal notation. For example, the following code
              creates an object that represents a person:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    let person = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    greet: function() {
        return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`;
    }
};
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              You can access the properties of an object using the dot notation
              (.) or the bracket notation ([]). For example, you can access the
              <color>name</color> and <color>age</color> properties of the
              <color>person</color> object using:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    console.log(person.name); // "John"
console.log(person["age"]); // 30
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              You can also add, update and delete properties to an object by
              using the dot notation or the bracket notation.
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    person.address = "New York";
person["phone"] = "123-456-7890";
delete person.age;
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              JavaScript objects also have built-in methods such as
              <color>hasOwnProperty()</color>, <color>valueOf()</color>,
              <color>toString()</color> etc.
              <br />
              Objects in JavaScript can also be created using a constructor
              function, which is a special kind of function that is used to
              create and initialize new objects. For example, the following code
              defines a constructor function <color>Person</color> that can be
              used to create new <color>Person</color> objects:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    function Person(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.greet = function() {
        return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`;
    }
}

let person1 = new Person("John", 30);
let person2 = new Person("Jane", 25);
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              In addition, JavaScript also provides a
              <color>Object()</color> constructor function that can be used to
              create an empty object with no properties.
              <br />
              In conclusion, objects in JavaScript are a fundamental concept
              that are used to represent real-world entities. They can be
              created using object literal notation or constructor functions,
              and they have properties and methods that can be accessed and
              manipulated. Understanding how to work with objects in JavaScript
              is essential for creating robust and maintainable code, and also
              it's the foundation of OOP in JavaScript.

              using the
              <color>constructor</color> keyword.
              <br />
              A constructor function is defined using the
              <color>function</color> keyword, followed by the function name,
              which is typically the name of the class. The constructor function
              takes in any required parameters and assigns them to the object's
              properties.
              <br />
              For example, consider the following constructor function
              <color>Person</color> that defines a person's name and age:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    function Person(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
}
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              To create a new object using the constructor function, you use the
              <color>new</color> keyword followed by the function name and any
              required parameters:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    let person1 = new Person("John", 30);
let person2 = new Person("Jane", 25);
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              The <color>this</color> keyword inside the constructor function
              refers to the current object being created. The
              <color>this</color> keyword is used to assign the properties
              passed in as arguments to the new object being created.
              <br />
              In addition to initializing properties, constructors can also
              define methods for objects created from the constructor. For
              example, you can add a method called <color>greet()</color> that
              returns a greeting message:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    function Person(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.greet = function() {
        return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`;
</Code>

            <h3>Static Method</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              In object-oriented programming, a static method is a method that
              is associated with a class, rather than an instance of the class.
              In JavaScript, static methods are defined using the
              <color>static</color> keyword and they can be accessed without
              creating an instance of the class.
              <br />
              For example, consider the following class
              <color>MathHelper</color> that defines a static method called
              <color>add()</color> that takes in two numbers and returns their
              sum:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    class MathHelper {
    static add(a, b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              You can access the static method directly from the class, without
              creating an instance of the class.
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    console.log(MathHelper.add(1, 2)); // 3
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              Static methods are useful when you want to add utility methods to
              a class that don't depend on the state of an instance. For
              example, you might use a static method to generate a unique ID for
              an object, or to perform a calculation that doesn't depend on the
              state of an instance.
              <br />
              It's important to note that static methods do not have access to
              the
              <color>this</color> keyword, as they are not associated with an
              instance of the class. Instead, they can only access the arguments
              passed in to the method and any variables or functions defined
              within the class.
              <br />
              In conclusion, static methods in JavaScript are methods that are
              associated with a class, rather than an instance of the class.
              They are
              <color>defined</color> using the static keyword and can be
              accessed directly from the class, without creating an instance of
              the class. Static methods are useful when you want to add utility
              methods to a class that don't depend on the state of an instance.
              However, it's important to keep in mind that static methods do not
              have access to the <color>this</color> keyword.

            <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
            <p>
              Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented
              programming (OOP) that refers to the practice of hiding the
              internal details of an object from other objects and code. In
              JavaScript, encapsulation is achieved by using closures and access
              modifiers, such as the
              <color>private</color> and <color>public</color> keywords.
              <br />
              JavaScript uses closures to implement encapsulation, which allows
              developers to create private variables and methods that cannot be
              accessed from outside the object. For example, consider the
              following code:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    function Person(name, age) {
    let privateAge = age;
    this.name = name;

    this.getAge = function() {
        return privateAge;
    }
}

let person = new Person("John", 30);
console.log(person.name); // "John"
console.log(person.privateAge); // undefined
console.log(person.getAge()); // 30
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              In this example, the <color>privateAge</color> variable is defined
              inside the constructor function and can only be accessed using the
              <color>getAge</color> method. This means that the internal state
              of the object is hidden from other objects and code, providing a
              level of protection and security.
              <br />
              Access modifiers such as <color>private</color>,
              <color>public</color> and <color>protected</color> are not
              natively supported in javascript, but it can be implemented using
              closures as well. In addition, other libraries and frameworks such
              as TypeScript provide a way to use access modifiers.
              <br />
              In conclusion, encapsulation is a fundamental concept in OOP that
              allows developers to hide the internal details of an object from
              other objects and code. In JavaScript, encapsulation is achieved
              by using closures and access modifiers, such as the
              <color>private</color> and <color>public</color> keywords. This
              allows developers to protect the internal state of an object and
              create more robust and maintainable code. Encapsulation is not
              natively supported in javascript but it can be implemented using
              closures and other libraries like TypeScript.

            <h3>Inheritance</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented
              programming (OOP) that allows developers to create a new class
              that inherits properties and methods from an existing class. In
              JavaScript, inheritance is achieved by using the
              <color>prototype</color> property and the
              <color>Object.create()</color> method.
              <br />
              JavaScript uses a prototype-based inheritance model, which means
              that objects can inherit properties and methods from other
              objects. Each object has a <color>prototype</color> property that
              refers to another object, and properties and methods are inherited
              by traversing the prototype chain.
              <br />
              For example, consider the following code:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    function Person(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
}

Person.prototype.greet = function() {
    return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`;
}

function Student(name, age, major) {
    Person.call(this, name, age);
    this.major = major;
}

Student.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);
Student.prototype.constructor = Student;

let student = new Student("John", 25, "Computer Science");
console.log(student.greet()); // "Hello, my name is John and I am 25 years old."
console.log(student.major); // "Computer Science"
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              In this example, the <color>Student</color> class inherits
              properties and methods from the <color>Person</color> class. The
              <color>Object.create()</color> method is used to create a new
              object that inherits from the
              <color>Person.prototype</color> object, and the
              <color>constructor</color> property is reset to the
              <color>Student</color> class.
              <br />
              In JavaScript, the inheritance model is a bit different from other
              languages like Java or C#, where classes inherit from other
              classes and the subclass has access to the methods and properties
              of the superclass. In javascript, it's based on the prototype
              chain, where each object has a prototype property that refers to
              another object and it inherits properties and methods by
              traversing the prototype chain.
              <br />
              In conclusion, inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP that
              allows developers to create a new class that inherits properties
              and methods from an existing class. In JavaScript, inheritance is
              achieved by using the
              <color>prototype</color> property and the
              <color>Object.create()</color> method. This allows developers to
              create reusable code and create a more organized and maintainable
              codebase. Understanding the prototype-based inheritance model in
              javascript is essential to be able to use inheritance effectively
              in javascript.

            <h3>Polymorphism</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented
              programming (OOP) that refers to the ability of different objects
              to respond to the same method call in different ways. In
              JavaScript, polymorphism is achieved by using function overloading
              and function overriding.
              <br />
              Function overloading refers to the ability of a function to have
              multiple implementations based on the number and/or types of
              arguments passed to it. JavaScript does not support function
              overloading natively, however, you can achieve similar
              functionality by using the arguments object and checking the
              number and/or types of arguments passed to the function.
              <br />
              Function overriding refers to the ability of a subclass to provide
              a different implementation of a method that is already provided by
              its superclass. In JavaScript, this can be achieved by reassigning
              the prototype of the subclass.
              <br />
              For example, consider the following code:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    class Shape {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
    draw() {
        console.log(`Drawing a ${this.name}`);
    }
}

class Circle extends Shape {
    draw() {
        console.log(`Drawing a Circle`);
    }
}

class Square extends Shape {
    draw() {
        console.log(`Drawing a Square`);
    }
}

let shape = new Shape("Shape");
let circle = new Circle();
let square = new Square();

shape.draw(); //Drawing a Shape
circle.draw(); //Drawing a Circle
square.draw(); //Drawing a Square
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              In this example, the <color>draw()</color> method is overridden in
              the subclasses <color>Circle</color> and <color>Square</color>,
              providing a different implementation of the method that is already
              provided by the superclass <color>Shape</color>.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In conclusion, polymorphism is a fundamental concept in OOP that
              refers to the ability of different objects to respond to the same

            <h3>Abstraction</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented
              programming (OOP) that refers to the practice of hiding the
              implementation details of an object and exposing only the
              essential features to the user. In JavaScript, abstraction is
              achieved by using abstract classes and interfaces.
              <br />
              An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is
              meant to be used as a base class for other classes. Abstract
              classes typically contain one or more abstract methods, which are
              methods that have a signature but no implementation. These methods
              must be implemented by the derived classes.
              <br />
              JavaScript does not support abstract classes natively, but you can
              achieve similar functionality by using a combination of function
              constructors and prototypes.
              <br />
              For example, consider the following code:
            </p>
            <br />
            <pre class="highlight">
<Code class="language-js">
    function Shape() {
    if (this.constructor === Shape) {
        throw new Error("Cannot instantiate abstract class Shape");
    }
    this.draw = function() {
        throw new Error("Cannot call abstract method draw from Shape");
    }
}

function Circle() {
    Shape.call(this);
    this.draw = function() {
        console.log("Drawing a Circle");
    }
}
Circle.prototype = Object.create(Shape.prototype);
Circle.prototype.constructor = Circle;

let circle = new Circle();
circle.draw(); // "Drawing a Circle"
let shape = new Shape(); // Error: Cannot instantiate abstract class Shape
</Code>
</Pre>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              In this example, the <color>Shape</color> class is an abstract
              class that cannot be instantiated and contains an abstract method
              <color>draw()</color> which throws an error when called. The
              <color>Circle</color> class inherits from the
              <color>Shape</color> class and implements the
              <color>draw()</color> method providing a specific implementation.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Interfaces are another way to achieve abstraction in JavaScript,
              although it's not a native feature of javascript. Some libraries
              like TypeScript provide interfaces. An interface defines a set of
              methods that a class must implement but does not provide an
              implementation for those methods. This allows developers to ensure
              that a class has the required methods without specifying how those
              methods should be implemented.
